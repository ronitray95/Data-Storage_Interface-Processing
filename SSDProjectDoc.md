## Our understanding of project
- We believe that we need to take as input a bunch of bibtex and constraints.
- We need to store this provided data on the server.
- The output of the project should be the bibtex and papers which match the provided filters.
- We can design the UI as we see fit.
- The technologies we can use consist of the Javascript and Python ecosystems.

## Approach
- Our approach will be linear towards building the project.
- We will be designing the API that can accept the bibtex in whichever format that is needed - CSV and JSON first.
- Then store the provided data in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or Firebase.
- This allows for more flexible indexing than SQL databases and will help us in filtering out data.
- We will have to use NLP techniques to apply the constraints for the user. For that we will be using NLP libraries such as NLTK & Spacy and we will need help of mentors and TAs.
- The final output of the process will be given to the user in 1 coherent piece.

## Relevant Study Material


## Milestones for us
1. Developing the front end API for user.
2. Parsing through the data and organzing all of it in storage.
3. Applying NLP techniques to filter bibtex.
4. Giving the output to the user.
