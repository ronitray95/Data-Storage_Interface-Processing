Although, Python was conceptualized in the late 1980s and after its implementation in 1989, it has emerged as a new multi-paradigm language platform with advent of Big Data. Python includes various data structures, standard libraries with the implementation of sentiment analysis and data science code. The real aim is to provide awareness to all the programmers about various facts of python language. It tells how Python works with various commercial and social communities and provides complete and desirable results. There are many areas and applications where Python makes its own stand as compared to other programming languages.', 'author': 'A. {Kumar} and S.
